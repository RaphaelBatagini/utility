# Ubuntu new installation

1. Wi-fi doesn't work
2. Install terminator with Oh My Zash

## 1. Wifi doesn't work
Wifi doesnt work after ubuntu install, so I used a wifi adapter to connect to internet and run the follow commands

```
$ sudo apt-get update
```
```
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## 2. Install terminator with Oh My Zash

```
sudo apt-get install terminator
