# 1. Wifi doesn't work #
Wifi doesnt work after ubuntu install, so I used a wifi adapter to connect to internet and run the follow commands

```
$ sudo apt-get update
```
```
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

# 2. Install git #
```
sudo apt-get install git
```

# 3. Install terminator with Oh My Zsh #

Install terminator
```
sudo apt-get install terminator
```

Install Zsh
```
sudo apt-get install zsh
```

Make Zsh default shell
```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Logout and login again to use the new shell.

Install Oh-My-Zsh
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

# 4. Install Apache #

Just run the following command
```
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

# 5. Install and configure MySQL #

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

Left root password empty. When the installation ends you'll need to create a new user with permission to access from 'outside' of local machine

Run
```
sudo su
```

And then
```
mysql -u root -p
```

Create new user
```
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; Â 
```

Grant all privileges
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'%'; 
```

# 6. Install PHP7 #
```
sudo apt-get install php7.0 
```
OR

```
sudo apt-get install php
```

If the above doesn't work try the following

```
sudo apt-get install php7.0 php7.0-fpm php7.0-mysql -y
```

## 6.1. Install PHP GD ##
```
sudo apt-get install php-gd
```

# 7. Download and install Workbench #

Download DEB package from here
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Run the following command (Maybe you should have to change the file name)
```
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/mysql-workbench-community.deb
```

And finally
```
sudo apt-get -f install
```

# 8. Install Sublime #

Add repository
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3
```

Update everything
```
sudo apt-get update 
```

And then install
```
sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer
```
